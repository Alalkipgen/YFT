# Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — Discovery and feasibility | COMPLETE | Architecture, support matrix, ADRs and compileable Media3/WebView spike validated locally and in CI |
| 1 — Foundation | COMPLETE | Production modules, Compose navigation shell, DI/data/media foundations, tests and CI validated on the work branch |
| 2 — Browser/detection | NOT STARTED | Next permitted phase; explicitly authorized by the user after Phase 1 completion |
| 3 — Preview/variants | NOT STARTED | — |
| 4 — Download engines | NOT STARTED | — |
| 5 — Site adapters | NOT STARTED | — |
| 6 — Hardening/UI | NOT STARTED | — |
| 7 — Signed beta/release | NOT STARTED | — |

## Current phase

Phase 1 is complete on `work/phase-1-foundation`. Phase 2 is the next permitted phase and must start on `work/phase-2-browser-detection` from the Phase 1 completion commit. Do not merge either branch into `main` without explicit approval and a green validation.

## Completed in Phase 1

- Added the Gradle 8.9 wrapper with a pinned distribution checksum.
- Created the production modules defined in `ARCHITECTURE.md`:
  - `:app`
  - `:core-model`
  - `:core-data`
  - `:core-browser`
  - `:core-media`
  - `:core-download`
  - `:extractor-api`
  - `:extractor-generic`
  - `:extractor-sites`
- Added the `com.alal.yft` production app and `.debug` debug application suffix.
- Implemented a Compose/Material 3 shell with all eight required routes and back navigation.
- Added light/dark/system themes with ViewModel/StateFlow events and DataStore persistence.
- Wired Hilt providers and boundaries for Room, DataStore, OkHttp and Media3.
- Added Room schema export, a DAO baseline test and a validated v1→v2 migration.
- Added structured `AppResult`/`AppError` types and secret-redacting logging.
- Added a Robolectric Compose smoke test for Home, every destination and back navigation.
- Expanded GitHub Actions to run Android lint, all Android/JVM unit tests and the debug build for work branches and pull requests.
- Configured and locally validated debug and minified release builds.

## Phase 1 validation

- Full local command passed with JDK 17.0.20.1, Android SDK 35 and Gradle 8.9:

```bash
./gradlew --no-daemon \
  lintDebug \
  testDebugUnitTest \
  :core-model:test \
  :extractor-api:test \
  :extractor-generic:test \
  :extractor-sites:test \
  :app:assembleDebug \
  :app:assembleRelease
```

- Result: **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** in 4m 31s; debug and unsigned minified release APKs assembled.
- GitHub Actions final checkpoint validation passed in run `36793372961`.
- A forced fresh split validation also passed: lint/tests/debug ran 279 tasks with 20 tests and zero failures; release assembly ran 207 tasks.
- The Compose navigation smoke test is included in `testDebugUnitTest`.
- No physical Android device/emulator was available, so direct/HLS/DASH playback and on-device rendering remain tracked runtime tests rather than claimed support.
