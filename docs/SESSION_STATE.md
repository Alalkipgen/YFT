# Session State

Update this file before every checkpoint push. Keep it factual so another chat can resume.

Phase 12 runs three agents at the same time. **Each agent edits only its own section below**
(`## Agent A …`, `## Agent B …`, `## Agent C …`); `## Overview` belongs to the plan and to P26.
Keep at least the heading and one blank line between sections, so Git merges them cleanly.

## Overview (plan and integration — P26 only)

- Phase: 12 — Preview #3 field fixes (saving, every quality, one sheet). Plan:
  `docs/FIX_ADD_PLAN.md`; prompts: `docs/prompts/README.md`.
- Branches: integration `work/phase-12-integration` = `main` `4db6c2b` + the plan commit. Agent A
  `work/phase-12-download-fix` (P20, P21, later P26), Agent B `work/phase-12-site-qualities`
  (P22, P23), Agent C `work/phase-12-generic-sheet` (P24, P25); all start from
  `origin/work/phase-12-integration`. Merge order A → B → C (P26), then Preview #4; P8 (signed
  `1.0.0-beta.4`) only with the owner's OK. Nobody pushes to `main` without the owner's OK.
- Owner's test of Preview #3 (2026-10-06, run 37455870506, `4db6c2b`): video downloads fail
  "Storage unavailable" at 0 B (Retry too), YouTube only 360p, Facebook HD/SD without Audio
  (Home) or 360p only (browser), another site opens a 29 s preview and says "50 media found",
  the sheet differs per site. Root causes R1–R6 in FIX_ADD_PLAN §4.
- Rules: ADR-006 public videos only; no DRM/paywall/private/age-gate bypass; adapters never sign
  in. Never print/commit cookies, tokens, visitor data, signed media/image URLs or keys. Keep
  testTags, Kotlin lines ≤ 100, WebView on the main thread. No reset --hard/clean/stash. One
  Gradle command at a time; temporary files outside the repo.
- Environment: `/data/YFT`; JDK 17 `/data/toolchains/jdk17`; SDK `/data/toolchains/android-sdk`
  (platform 35, NDK 27.3.13750724, CMake 3.22.1); `source /data/yft-env.sh`; full validation with
  `GRADLE_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=640m"`. After a sandbox reset recreate the helper
  files, reinstall missing SDK parts and `git pull --ff-only` first. Push with the deploy key
  configured in `core.sshCommand`; never print it.
- Phase 11 record (per-task Results, validation, CI runs, Track A/B notes):
  `git show 4db6c2b:docs/SESSION_STATE.md`.
- Last pushed checkpoint: PLAN — Phase 12 plan and prompts (this commit).
- Next: the owner pastes the prompts for Agents A, B and C (three chats, at the same time).
- Last updated: 2026-10-06 (Phase 12 plan, Plan Mode; no app code changed)
